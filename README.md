# Robotic_Arm_API

The purpose of this library is to create a robust and versatile API to interface with a 4 DOF robotic arm that utilizes the SG90 servo for motion. This library is written in arduino and will allow the user to either command each motor individually, or choose a point in 3D space that the robotic arm will be able to locate and move to.

In future iterations of this project, this library may also support pressure sensors that allow the arm to detect whether it is grasping something.
